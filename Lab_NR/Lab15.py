#4. A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. All 3
# sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the
# same length, and a third side that is a different length. If all of the sides have different lengths then the
# triangle is scalene. Write a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user.Display a
# message indicating the type of the triangle.
