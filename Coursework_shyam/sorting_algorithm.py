##Insertion sorting


'''
1. Traverse though the array
2. target the key and compare with the next
3. For ascending order, start from the begining
    if the next number is greater then do not swap the position,
     if the next number is less, then mark it as a key and keep on comparing till a number comes which is greater than the number set on the ket.'''
